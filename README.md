# Simple Website Template
A simple, responsive website template using bootsrap.

# Initialization
This project uses `npm` to handle dependencies. To donwload dependencies run:

```
$ npm install
```

Instead of CSS, this project uses SCSS.
I've added `sass` as an `npm` dependency as well as a run target. To run `sass` and compile the `.scss` source file run:

```
$ npm run sass
```
