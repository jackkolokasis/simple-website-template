          <h3>Session 1: Preparing For a Job Interview</h3>
          <p>
          Software companies often have long and demanding interview processes.
          Such interview processes have multiple steps, each evaluating different skills of the candidate.
          In this session students from the Department as well as alumni, describe their experience going through the job/internship hunting process from the early preparation steps to their success on a job offer.
          The session includes short presentations and discussion and Q&A with the panelists.

            Session 2: Industry Panel
          </h3>
          <p>
          During an interview, recruiters pose questions or problems for applicants to answer in order to make sure the applicant is the right fit for the open position.
          </p>

          <p>
          In this session we will host a discussion and Q&A panel consisting of recruiters. These people will:
          <ul>
            <li>Share their perspective on a successful job interview</li>
            <li>Discuss the challenges during the recruiting, interviewing and hiring process</li>
            <li>Provide hints about “do’s and don’ts” based on their experience evaluating candidates</li>

          <h3>Session 3: Write a Successful CV</h3>
          <p>
          When it comes to job hunting, CV is an important factor that can lead to success! Preparing a CV that can highlight your skills and make you stand out is a tough challenge.
          Usually employees spend just a few seconds before deciding if your profile is ideal for the position you apply.
          Every CV is different and depends on the position you apply and the skills you want to highlight. However there are some fundamental principles when compiling a CV. 
          </p>
          <p>
          In this session, experts will guide you how to write a great CV and share tips that lead to success.
          It includes a short introduction of the experts and a 10 minutes talk with tips of a successful CV before the workshop (see session 4) with one-on-one slots with the experts.
